# Stephanie's fMRI Analysis Repository - Matlab

The contents are standalone scripts for fMRI analysis and a few other general tasks in Matlab.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Since these are standalone scripts, the only prerequisite is a working version of Matlab (everything should work with Matlab 2018b or greater).

### Overview

A few of these materials have been developed to conduct the core analyses for a project, including:

1. Generalizability Theory ICC toolbox: reliability > ICC > ICC\_toolbox 

Noble, S., Spann, M. N., Tokoglu, F., Shen, X., Constable, R. T., & Scheinost, D. (2017). Influences on the testâ€“retest reliability of functional connectivity MRI and its relationship with behavioral utility. Cerebral Cortex, 27(11), 5415-5429.

and

2. Summarizing true positives in cluster extent-based inference: clf

(Under review) 
See also shell scripts for estimating true positives.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the materials provided here! Although I try to make all my code publicly available, some of the materials have been developed for more private use and may therefore require further explanationn.
